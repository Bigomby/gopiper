package component

// Component represents any element in the pipeline that performs some work
// on a message.
//
// A component should call the callback function to report the status of the
// action performed. Depending on the report, the following actions will
// occurr:
//
// - Done (code 0): The message has been successfully processed and should
// be sent to the next component of the pipeline.
// - Continue (code 1): The message has been successfully processed, but
// the message should not be sent to the next component of the pipeline.
// - Retry (code 100 - 199): The component has failed to process the message
// and should be retried.
// - Fail (code 200-299): The component has failed to process the message and
// the message should be discarded.
// - Discard (300+): Silently drop the message.
